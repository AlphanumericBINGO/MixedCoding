            <h3>Python</h3>
            <img src="Python_EXAMPLE.png">
            <p>I have been coding python for a while and I am relatively proficient at it. 
                I spend my time creating projects such as wordle (using ASCII art) and then 
                converting it into a graphical user interface, normally Tkinter. I have also
                 made a class called 'Str_Mod' although I have not published it due to the 
                 inability to use PIP. I use it regularly when the time comes to use it.</p>
            <h4>Flask</h4>
            <p>I am starting to use flask as the website backend.Flask says hello! This is your name: {{ name }}</p>
        <div id="html">
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <img src="HTML_EXAMPLE.png">
            <p>I have learnt HTML only quite recently and have enjoyed the 'visual satisfaction' 
                that does not come from python, and the ease to pinpoint errors. I have made 
                different websites, including this one, and a birthday card.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="css">
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <img src="CSS_EXAMPLE.png">
            <p>This is similar to the HTML one, but is slightly harder as the attributes are 
                harder to actually understand without some help</p>
